citigroup expects microsoft boost payouts investors month anticipating big dividend increase certainly agree company capacity cautious prospects business well operating assets risen nearly value past

thesis deliveries model peaked remains force spite tesla talking sequential growth north american net orders also spite growth customer deposits fact means tesla deliveries estimate danger unless china uk japan spring large surprise estimate would probably require growth tesla nasdaq tsla starts day red reporting earnings people continue grasp onto floating debris keep beliefs alive tesla

underlying demand current represented deliveries knowing tesla investors predisposition believe tesla management threw bone following statement north american net orders grew sequentially quarter always pursuing expansion direct sales model accelerate transition sustainable transportation selling directly allows us effectively communicate unique benefits electric cars potential customers well improve buying servicing experience suddenly struggling speculators piece wood grab onto god peaked deliveries thesis false surely tesla lie onto us putting aside fact delivery numbers clearly objectively dropping quarter quarter makes discussing somewhat unreal ll highlight following first tesla say referring north american net orders model likely means referring model instead including model net orders phrase rendering true sure include model net orders climbing sequentially hard even model net orders dropping sequentially need model orders amounting model orders roughly cars net orders north america rising sequentially secondly also relevant tesla chose comment sequential orders talk quarter quarter orders also comment year year orders significant implication coincidence year year orders negative thus keeping peaked thesis alive either way lack transparency ominous doesn matter much deliveries estimates speak louder hollow pieces driftwood tesla would simply better disclose everything regarding orders sales instead tesla doesn even break geographies point breaking geographies ever relevant tesla starting ship cars china uk right hand drive later summer japan without knowing many cars going new markets difficult gauge existing markets still tesla guiding deliveries including china uk seems easy tell much way growth markets ex china uk another source hope tesla fans way customer deposits growing assumptions stretched conclude best demand exploding orders gazillions cars already books siddharth dalal tesla earnings call decimates bear arguments shows

club forum production model signature model maximum possible deposit model million tesla however holds deposits million leaving million model backlog cars deposit per car however tesla hold orders signature models markets signature order ratio model assume model tesla holds signature orders half market model would represent backlog model lower bound kind backlog demand slowdown thesis soundly

reserving model cost yuan china least late january yuan roughly china taking orders since august late january gotten several hundred reservations asking deposits one clearly great deal million model reservations chinese orders would consume million even customer deposits wildly misleading regarding demand model certainly imply tens thousands units yet delivered still tesla delivering first units

profitable ventures take companies generally look return excess flow shareholders usually takes form share repurchases dividends point dividends alluded somewhat already easily observed following performance table dividend initiated growing healthy pace since despite idea microsoft still paying well half profits microsoft started dividend party right offering special dividend behind scenes share repurchase program begun take hold well using fundamental underlying number fun chart see microsoft began substantially reducing share count much common shares outstanding declined almost per year last years moving forward believe important keep concepts mind apparent microsoft likely return fast growth days yesteryear however company expected grow decent pace moving forward specifically analysts come consensus long term earnings per share growth rate estimate unimaginable given room population growth new products coupled healthy buyback program estimates come fruition microsoft shares trade multiple future would represent annualized return paramount underscore idea simply calculator provide sensible baseline analysts presently viewing company sum look standard graph often
